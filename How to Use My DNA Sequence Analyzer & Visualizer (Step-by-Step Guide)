🧬 How to Use My DNA Sequence Analyzer & Visualizer (Step-by-Step Guide)
I recently developed a bioinformatics mini-project, DNA-Sequence-Analyzer-Visualizer, a Python-based tool designed to analyze and visualize DNA sequences.
If you're a student exploring bioinformatics, computational biology, or biomedical data analysis, here’s how you can use it:
🔹 Step 1: Open the Notebook
Visit the GitHub repository and open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file).
You can:
• Run it directly in Google Colab (recommended for beginners)
• Or download and run it locally using Jupyter Notebook
🔹 Step 2: Input Your DNA Sequence
Inside the notebook, locate the DNA variable:
Copy code
Python
dna = "ATGCCGT"
Replace it with your own DNA sequence (A, T, G, C only).
Example:
Copy code
Python
dna = "ATGCGTAGCTAGCTAGC"
🔹 Step 3: Execute the Analysis
Click Run All (or execute cells step-by-step).
The tool will automatically:
✅ Count nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C)
✅ Calculate GC content (%)
✅ Display base distribution
✅ Generate a visualization chart
🔬 Why This Matters
Base composition and GC content analysis are foundational concepts in genomics and molecular biology.
This project demonstrates how biological sequence data can be processed, analyzed, and visualized using Python — bridging life sciences and computational methods.
